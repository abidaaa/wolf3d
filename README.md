# Wolf3d
This project helped me learn the concept Raycasting along side my teammate, I also implimented an interface
for the first time and music in the background as well,we used the power of mathematics to create elegant and efficient
algorithms. It was fun doing this project and I may continue developing it, in order to recreate the famous game "Doom 3D".

### What is Wolf3d?
This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90’s game, which
was the first FPS ever. It enabled me to explore ray-casting. The goal was to
make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you’ll have to find your way.
Here is some examples :

### How do I use it?

### *Installation*

To generate an executable for this project run make in the root of the project directory. 
This project will only work on MacOS El Capitan/Sierra/HighSierra(maybe) and even then, no promises!

### *Usage*

After running make to generate the Wolf3d executable you can run the program with ./wolf3d


Enjoy.
